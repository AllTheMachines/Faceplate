Milestone v1 is COMPLETE. All 8 phases executed and verified. 30/30 plans completed.

The VST3 WebView UI Designer is fully functional:
- Visual design canvas with pan/zoom
- 6 element types (knob, slider, button, label, meter, image)
- Selection, undo/redo, copy/paste
- Drag-drop from palette
- Property editing with type-specific panels
- Save/load JSON projects
- Export to JUCE WebView2 bundle or HTML preview
</current_state>

**All 8 phases complete:**

**Total execution time:** 1.36 hours (avg 2.7 min/plan)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
No phase work remaining. Milestone complete.

**Recommended next steps:**
1. `/gsd:audit-milestone` - Verify requirements coverage, cross-phase integration, E2E flows
2. `/gsd:verify-work` - Manual acceptance testing of the full application
3. `/gsd:complete-milestone` - Archive and prepare for v2 planning
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
Key architectural decisions for the milestone:

- **HTML/CSS rendering** over react-konva for true WYSIWYG (elements render exactly as exported)
- **Zustand + zundo** for state management with undo/redo
- **@dnd-kit** for drag-drop interactions
- **browser-fs-access** for progressive file save enhancement
- **JSZip** for client-side ZIP bundle creation
- **JUCE API pattern**: getSliderState for knobs/sliders, getToggleState for buttons
- **Missing parameterId**: Generate TODO comment instead of broken code
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None. All features implemented and verified.

<context>
The v1 milestone delivers the core value proposition: "Visually design a plugin UI and export code that works in JUCE WebView2 without manual fixups."

The export generates:
- **JUCE Bundle (5 files):** index.html, styles.css, components.js, bindings.js, bindings.cpp
- **HTML Preview (4 files):** Same as above minus C++, with mock window.__JUCE__ backend

All 35 v1 requirements are marked complete in REQUIREMENTS.md.
</context>

<next_action>
When resuming, run `/gsd:audit-milestone` to verify the milestone before archiving.

This will check:
- All requirements marked complete actually work
- Cross-phase integration (e.g., palette → canvas → properties → export)
- End-to-end user flows complete successfully
</next_action>
