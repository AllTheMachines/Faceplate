<current_state>
All planned milestones (v1.0-v1.7) are complete and shipped.
Just added a feature request: requestParamSync for reliable UI initialization.
This feature was committed and pushed to GitHub.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- v1.7 Parameter Sync milestone: Complete
- requestParamSync feature: Added to jsGenerator.ts
  - JS calls bridge.requestParamSync() after all UI elements initialized
  - C++ responds by pushing all parameter values
  - Replaces unreliable timer-based delays
- Documentation updated: JUCE_INTEGRATION.md, JUCE_PATTERN.md, EXPORT_FORMAT.md
- Committed and pushed: 264011d
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Uncommitted changes from previous sessions (not related to requestParamSync):
  - Properties components (.tsx files)
  - src/schemas/project.ts
  - UI_SPECS_PLUGINS/Noise_withDevMode.json
  - .claude/ config files
  - New docs: FACEPLATE_SYNC_GUIDE.md, GENERATE_UI_SKILL.md
- These appear to be from earlier work, review before committing
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- requestParamSync checks for function existence before calling (graceful fallback)
- If C++ doesn't register requestParamSync, logs info message and continues
- Added to Standard Functions table in JUCE_PATTERN.md
</decisions_made>

<context>
Project is feature-complete per original roadmap. The requestParamSync feature was added
as a post-milestone enhancement based on user request. The C++ side implementation is
already done on the user's plugin side - this change adds the JS side to call it.

Flow: DAW loads -> WebView initializes -> JS sets up all UI -> JS calls requestParamSync
-> C++ pushes all parameter values -> UI shows correct state

<next_action>
No active development. If resuming:
1. Review uncommitted changes from previous sessions
2. Decide what to commit vs discard
3. Or wait for next feature request
