<current_state>
v1.9 Layers & Help System milestone has been completed and archived. All planning docs updated, documentation refreshed, git tagged v1.9. Project is ready for next milestone definition.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
## v1.9 Milestone (SHIPPED)
- Phase 41: Bug Fixes (2/2 plans) - folder export, container multi-drag
- Phase 42: Layers Panel (5/5 plans) - full layer system with visibility/lock/z-order
- Phase 43: Help System (4/4 plans) - contextual help, F1 shortcut, 102 elements documented

## Milestone Completion
- Audit passed (18/18 requirements, 26/26 truths verified)
- Archived to `.planning/milestones/v1.9-*.md`
- REQUIREMENTS.md deleted (fresh for next milestone)
- ROADMAP.md collapsed to one-line summary
- PROJECT.md evolved with Validated requirements
- STATE.md reset for next milestone
- Git tag v1.9 created
- Documentation updated (README, WORKFLOW, BEST_PRACTICES, ELEMENT_REFERENCE)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
## Next Steps
1. Run `/gsd:new-milestone` to start v2.0 planning
   - Questioning phase to gather requirements
   - Research phase for domain exploration
   - Requirements definition
   - Roadmap creation

## Potential v2.0 Features (from BACKLOG.md or deferred items)
- LAYER-10: Group layers without changing element hierarchy
- LAYER-11: Multi-select in layers with Ctrl/Shift click
- LAYER-12: Show nested hierarchy for containers with children
- HELP-08: Searchable help index page
- HELP-09: Cross-linked help topics
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Used react-arborist for layer drag-drop (tree structure with reorder support)
- Blob URLs for help popups (avoids external files, inline HTML)
- Layer colors appear on selection handles (visual identification)
- F1 shows element help when one selected, general help otherwise
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - milestone complete, ready for next phase of development.

<context>
Project has shipped 10 milestones in 7 days (v1.0-v1.9). The designer is feature-rich with 100+ element types, layers system, help documentation, multi-window support, and professional export.

Next milestone should focus on either:
1. User-reported issues/feature requests
2. Deferred layer/help enhancements
3. New major features based on user feedback
</context>

<next_action>
Start with: `/gsd:new-milestone` to begin v2.0 planning cycle

Alternative: Review BACKLOG.md for priority items or gather user feedback first.
