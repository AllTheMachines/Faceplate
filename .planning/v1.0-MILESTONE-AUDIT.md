## Integration Check Results

### Cross-Phase Wiring: Complete (100%)

**Verified Integrations:**
- ✓ Store → All 20+ components (useStore hook)
- ✓ Palette (24 items) → Canvas → Store (all 22 element types)
- ✓ Selection → PropertyPanel → Store (22/22 element types)
- ✓ Store → Serialization → FileSystem (save/load works)
- ✓ Store → Export Generators (all 22 types generate HTML/CSS/JS)
- ✓ Template Import → Store (6 core types supported)

**Gaps Closed (commit d3e225f):**

1. ✓ **RangeSlider Property Panel** - Import and render added to PropertyPanel.tsx
2. ✓ **ModulationMatrix Property Panel** - Import and render added to PropertyPanel.tsx

All 22 element types now have full property editing support.

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 2: Element Library
- **Item:** Interfaces include essential v1 properties only
- **Context:** Plan explicitly prioritized "essential v1 properties over exhaustive list"
- **Impact:** Users can build 80% of plugin UIs (phase goal met)
- **Future:** Expand interfaces when specific advanced features needed

### Phase 4: Palette & Element Creation
- **Items:** Element type mismatch, SVG hardcoded position
- **Status:** Fixed during phase via gap closure plans 04-05, 04-06
- **Impact:** None (resolved)

### Phase 9: Enhancements
- **Item:** Lock all mode UI toggle missing in RightPanel
- **Context:** Backend works, UI button was not added
- **Impact:** Low (individual element locking works)
- **Future:** Add toggle button to RightPanel

### Phase 13: Extended Elements
- **Items:** RangeSlider and ModulationMatrix property panels not wired
- **Status:** ✓ FIXED (commit d3e225f)
- **Resolution:** Added imports and render calls to PropertyPanel.tsx

---

## Human Verification Items

Collected from phase verifications. These were recommended for manual testing but do not block verification:

- Visual rendering at various zoom levels
- Pan/zoom interaction smoothness
- Property updates during drag/resize
- Keyboard shortcut conflicts with text input
- Export file contents in real JUCE project

---

## Milestone Definition of Done

From PROJECT.md and REQUIREMENTS.md:

> **Core Value:** Visually design a plugin UI and export code that works in JUCE WebView2 without manual fixups.

### Verification:

✓ **Three-panel layout** - Palette, Canvas, Properties
✓ **Canvas with configurable dimensions** - 100-4000px range
✓ **Drag elements from palette** - 22 element types
✓ **Position elements** - Drag, resize, nudge, snap
