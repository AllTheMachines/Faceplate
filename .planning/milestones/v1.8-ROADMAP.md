**Goal**: Fix reported bugs and add quality-of-life improvements
**Plans**: 8 plans in 2 waves

Plans:

- [x] 40-01-PLAN.md — Fix critical state bugs (version, name validation, multi-window duplicate)
- [x] 40-02-PLAN.md — Add Button borderWidth property
- [x] 40-03-PLAN.md — Fix color picker and label/value distance
- [x] 40-04-PLAN.md — Add folder export option
- [x] 40-05-PLAN.md — Container editor snap-to-grid
- [x] 40-06-PLAN.md — Container editor copy/paste/duplicate
- [x] 40-07-PLAN.md — Alt/Ctrl+click to deselect from multi-select
- [x] 40-08-PLAN.md — Fix font weight display and preview consistency

#### Wave Structure

| Wave | Plans | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 40-01, 40-02, 40-03, 40-04, 40-08 | Critical bugs & folder export (parallel) |
| 2 | 40-05, 40-06, 40-07 | Container editor & selection (parallel) |

#### Bugs Addressed

| ID | Description | Plan | Priority |
|----|-------------|------|----------|
| BUG-40-01 | Font weight names incorrect in preview | 40-08 | High |
| BUG-40-02 | Button border thickness not editable | 40-02 | Medium |
| BUG-40-03 | Duplicate name error after delete/recreate | 40-01 | High |
| BUG-40-04 | Color picker shows wrong color | 40-03 | Medium |
| BUG-40-05 | Label/value distance not editable | 40-03 | Medium |
| BUG-40-06 | Multi-window duplicate affects other windows | 40-01 | High |
| BUG-40-07 | Missing version causes migration error | 40-01 | High |

#### Features Addressed

| ID | Description | Plan | Priority |
|----|-------------|------|----------|
| FEAT-40-01 | Direct folder export | 40-04 | High |
| FEAT-40-02 | Container editor snap-to-grid | 40-05 | Medium |
| FEAT-40-03 | Container editor copy/paste | 40-06 | Medium |
| FEAT-40-06 | Alt/Ctrl+click deselect | 40-07 | Medium |

#### Deferred (Low Priority)

| ID | Description | Reason |
|----|-------------|--------|
| FEAT-40-04 | VST sync bidirectional | Requires C++ changes in VST repos |
| FEAT-40-05 | Merge INSTvst/EFXvst | Architectural scope too large for bug fix phase |
| FEAT-40-07 | Auto-generate UI from specs | New skill, not a bug fix |
| FEAT-40-08 | Layers system | Major feature, defer to v1.9 |

**Success Criteria (All Met):**
1. ✓ Font weights render correctly in preview matching canvas
2. ✓ Border thickness editable on all elements that support borders
3. ✓ Element naming works correctly after delete/recreate cycle
4. ✓ Color picker displays correct color matching hex value
5. ✓ Label/value distance configurable in properties panel
6. ✓ Multi-select duplication only affects current window
7. ✓ Project version stored in JSON with proper migration on load
8. ✓ Export can output to folder without creating zip
9. ✓ Container editor has snap-to-grid and copy/paste support
10. ✓ Alt/Ctrl+click deselects individual elements from multi-selection

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Version inference from structure when explicit version missing
- Window-scoped name validation using isNameUniqueInWindow helper
- File System Access API for folder export (Chromium browsers only)
- Snap-on-release behavior (same as main canvas) for container editor

**Issues Resolved:**
- Font weight names now show actual subfamily names (e.g., "Light (300)")
- Color picker syncs properly when switching elements
- Multi-window operations correctly scoped to active window
- Version migration handles missing version field gracefully

**Issues Deferred:**
- GitHub #2: Folder export creates subfolder for single-window projects
- GitHub #3: Container editor multi-select drag not working

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Pre-existing: V1→V2 migration missing showGrid/gridColor fields
