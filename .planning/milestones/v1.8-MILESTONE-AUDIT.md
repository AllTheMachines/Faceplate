| Skipped | 5 |
| Issues | 1 (+1 additional) |

### Skipped Tests (Edge Cases)
- Tests 1-3: Version/migration edge cases (user declined JSON manipulation)
- Tests 14-15: Font weight tests (no custom fonts available)

### Issues Found (Deferred to v1.9)

1. **GitHub #2: Folder export subfolder** (minor)
   - Single-window projects create unnecessary "main-window" subfolder
   - Root cause: No check for `windowsToExport.length === 1`

2. **GitHub #3: Container multi-select drag** (major)
   - Cannot drag multiple selected elements together in container editor
   - Root cause: DragState only tracks single element

## Integration Check

All Phase 40 integrations verified:

| Integration | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Version inference & migration | ✓ Connected |
| Button borderWidth property | ✓ Full round-trip |
| Color picker state sync | ✓ Connected |
| Folder export API | ✓ End-to-end |
| Container editor grid | ✓ Synced with main canvas |
| Container copy/paste | ✓ Full workflow |
| Alt/Ctrl+click deselection | ✓ Connected |
| Font weight display | ✓ Connected |

**Pre-existing issue (not Phase 40):**
- V1→V2 migration missing showGrid/gridColor fields (introduced Jan 28)

## Deliverables

### Plans Completed: 8/8
