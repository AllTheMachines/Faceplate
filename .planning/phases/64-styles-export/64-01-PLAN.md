<objective>
Write the complete element styles documentation for the Faceplate user manual.

Purpose: Give users an overview of the custom SVG styling system -- what styles are, how to apply them from the properties panel, how to manage them, and where to go for the full design workflow (STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md). This is an overview-plus-reference document, NOT a self-contained guide.
Output: `docs/manual/styles.md` -- a topic file satisfying STYLE-01 through STYLE-06.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write the element styles documentation</name>
  <files>docs/manual/styles.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/manual/styles.md` following the established topic file format from `assets.md` and `fonts.md`: title, overview paragraph, then content sections.

**IMPORTANT:** This is documentation only. No code changes. This is an OVERVIEW-PLUS-REFERENCE document -- it explains what styles are and how to use them in the UI, then links to STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md for the full SVG design workflow. Do NOT duplicate STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL content.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT DECISIONS (from 64-CONTEXT.md -- these are LOCKED):**
- Overview + reference approach: explain what styles are, how to apply/manage in UI, link to STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL for full workflow
- NOT a self-contained guide -- avoids duplicating STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL content
- Layer mapping dialog: brief mention with one paragraph, full details in STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL
- Color overrides: inline mention within "applying styles" section ("once applied, you can override colors per-instance in the properties panel") -- no dedicated subsection, no screenshot
- ManageElementStylesDialog: brief paragraph + screenshot placeholder -- what it shows (all styles, category filter), no step-by-step walkthrough
- Supported categories: general statement "knobs, sliders, buttons, and meters" -- no detailed category breakdown or table
- STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL reference: prominent callout near the top for discoverability
- Screenshot placeholders: 2 only -- style dropdown in properties panel, Manage Styles dialog
- No screenshot for: layer mapping dialog, color override controls

The file must contain these sections:

**1. Title and overview**
```
# Element Styles
```

2-3 sentence overview explaining what element styles are: they let you replace the default appearance of elements with custom SVG artwork. Supported for knobs, sliders, buttons, and meters. Each style is an SVG graphic with named layers that map to parts of the control (e.g., a knob's body, indicator, and cap).

**2. Prominent STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL callout (near top, after overview)**

A clearly visible paragraph linking to the Style Creation Manual. Something like:

"For a complete guide to designing custom SVG styles -- from exporting templates to naming layers and importing finished artwork -- see the [Style Creation Manual](../STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md)."

This must be prominent and near the top of the file for discoverability.

**3. Section: Creating a Style** (anchored as `## Creating a Style`)

Brief overview of the workflow (one paragraph, not a full walkthrough):
- Import a custom SVG through the Manage Styles dialog
- Faceplate automatically detects layers in the SVG based on their names
- The layer mapping dialog appears, showing which SVG layers were matched to which roles (e.g., body, indicator, track, thumb)
- After confirming the mapping, the style is saved and available to apply to elements

Reference that the full step-by-step for designing SVGs with correct layer names is in the [Style Creation Manual](../STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md).

Do NOT include a screenshot placeholder here (per CONTEXT -- layer mapping dialog screenshot is covered in STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL).

**4. Section: Applying Styles** (anchored as `## Applying Styles`)

Document how to apply a style to an element through the properties panel:

1. Select an element on the canvas (e.g., a knob, slider, button, or meter)
2. In the Properties panel, find the **Style** dropdown
3. The dropdown shows all available styles for that element's category
4. Select a style to apply it -- the element updates immediately on the canvas
5. Select **No style** to revert to the default appearance

Screenshot placeholder: `![Style dropdown in the Properties panel showing available styles for a knob](../images/styles-dropdown-properties.png)`

A thumbnail preview of the selected style appears below the dropdown, showing the SVG artwork at a small size.

**Inline color overrides mention (per CONTEXT -- within this section, not a separate subsection):**
"Once a style is applied, you can override individual layer colors in the Properties panel to customize the appearance per element instance without modifying the original style."

**5. Section: Managing Styles** (anchored as `## Managing Styles`)

Brief paragraph about the Manage Styles dialog:
- Access it by clicking **Manage styles...** below the style dropdown in the Properties panel
- Shows all styles for the current element category (e.g., all rotary styles when editing a knob)
- From here you can rename styles, delete styles (with a warning if elements are using them), and import new SVGs
- Elements using a deleted style revert to the default appearance

Screenshot placeholder: `![Manage Styles dialog showing imported styles with rename and delete options](../images/styles-manage-dialog.png)`

**6. Footer: navigation links**

[Back to User Manual](README.md) | [Style Creation Manual](../STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md) | [Properties Panel](properties.md) | [Asset Library](assets.md)
```

**Format rules (matching existing manual files):**
- Use bold for UI element names: **Style** dropdown, **Manage styles...**, **Properties** panel, **No style**
- Screenshot placeholder format: `![description](../images/filename.png)`
- Do NOT reference React components, TypeScript types, Zustand store, or implementation details
- Do NOT duplicate STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL content -- overview-plus-reference approach
- Flat prose style (no tip/note callout boxes)
- Keep the file concise -- this is an overview, not an exhaustive reference
