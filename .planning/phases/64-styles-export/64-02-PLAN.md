<objective>
Write the complete export system documentation for the Faceplate user manual.

Purpose: Give users a clear guide to exporting their plugin UI -- the primary JUCE WebView2 bundle workflow, the browser preview for quick testing, export options (ZIP vs folder, SVG optimization, responsive scaling), and what to do about Pro element blocking. Reference docs (JUCE_INTEGRATION.md, EXPORT_FORMAT.md) are linked in a footer, not inlined.
Output: `docs/manual/export.md` -- a topic file satisfying EXP-01 through EXP-06.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write the export system documentation</name>
  <files>docs/manual/export.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/manual/export.md` following the established topic file format from `assets.md` and `fonts.md`: title, overview paragraph, then content sections.

**IMPORTANT:** This is documentation only. No code changes. JUCE WebView2 bundle is the PRIMARY workflow. Browser preview is secondary ("quick test"). Technical details belong in EXPORT_FORMAT.md and JUCE_INTEGRATION.md, not here. Cross-references are consolidated at the bottom in a "See Also" footer.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT DECISIONS (from 64-CONTEXT.md -- these are LOCKED):**
- JUCE WebView2 bundle is the primary documented workflow, browser preview is secondary
- Brief file list of what gets generated (index.html, style.css, components.js, bindings.js, assets/) with one-line descriptions -- no code snippets
- Folder vs ZIP: one sentence within export workflow
- Multi-window export: one sentence
- Pro element blocking: inline within export workflow, not a dedicated subsection
- JUCE_INTEGRATION.md and EXPORT_FORMAT.md: "See Also" footer section at the bottom
- No inline links scattered through export body text
- Screenshot placeholders: 1 only -- export modal (with options visible)
- No screenshot for: Pro blocking modal, browser preview

The file must contain these sections:

**1. Title and overview**
```
# Export
```

2-3 sentence overview explaining what export does: Faceplate generates a complete code bundle from your design that runs inside a JUCE WebView2 component. The export produces all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed for your plugin UI. You can also preview your design in a browser for quick testing.

**2. Section: Exporting a JUCE WebView2 Bundle** (anchored as `## Exporting a JUCE WebView2 Bundle`)

This is the primary export workflow. Document it step-by-step:

1. Click the **Export** button in the toolbar (or use the Export panel in the left sidebar)
2. The Export modal opens showing your project summary and options

Screenshot placeholder: `![Export modal showing export mode, options, and action buttons](../images/export-modal.png)`

Document the export options visible in the modal (from ExportModal.tsx):

**Export Mode:**
- **ZIP Archive** -- Downloads a .zip file containing all generated files. Choose folder export for direct use, or ZIP for sharing/archiving.
- **Export to Folder** -- Writes files directly to a folder you choose on your system (requires Chrome, Edge, or Opera)

**Options:**
- **Optimize SVG assets** -- Reduces SVG file size in the exported bundle
- **Enable responsive scaling** -- Makes the UI scale to fit different window sizes
- **Include developer windows** -- Includes developer-type windows in the export (only appears if your project has developer windows)

3. Click **Export ZIP** or **Export Folder** to generate the bundle

**What gets generated (brief file list per CONTEXT -- one-line descriptions, no code):**
- **index.html** -- The UI layout with all your elements
- **style.css** -- Styling for colors, fonts, sizes, and positions
- **components.js** -- Interactive component logic (knobs, sliders, buttons)
- **bindings.js** -- Parameter binding between UI controls and JUCE backend
- **assets/** -- SVG graphics and font files used in your design
- **README.md** -- Integration instructions for your JUCE project

**Multi-window export (one sentence per CONTEXT):**
Multi-window projects export each window as a separate bundle in its own subfolder.

**Pro element blocking (inline per CONTEXT -- not a dedicated subsection):**
If your project contains Pro elements and you are on a Free license, Faceplate shows which Pro elements need to be removed or upgraded before you can export the JUCE bundle. Browser preview works without a Pro license.

**3. Section: Browser Preview** (anchored as `## Browser Preview`)

This is the secondary/quick-test section. Brief and practical:

The browser preview opens your design in a new browser tab with mock interactivity. Controls respond to mouse interaction (drag knobs, click buttons, move sliders) so you can test the look and feel without setting up JUCE.

To preview:
1. Open the Export modal
2. Click **Preview**

The preview generates the same HTML/CSS/JavaScript as a full export but runs it directly in the browser with a simulated JUCE backend. This is useful for checking layout, styling, and basic interaction before integrating with your JUCE project.

For multi-window projects, the preview shows all windows with tab navigation at the top, letting you switch between windows.

Note: the preview may require allowing popups in your browser settings. If the preview does not open, check your browser's popup blocker.

**4. Footer: See Also + navigation links (per CONTEXT -- all references consolidated here)**

```
## See Also

```

**Format rules (matching existing manual files):**
- Use bold for UI element names: **Export** button, **Preview** button, **ZIP Archive**, **Export to Folder**
- Screenshot placeholder format: `![description](../images/filename.png)`
- Do NOT reference React components, TypeScript types, Zustand store, or implementation details
- Do NOT include code snippets or file structure trees (that belongs in EXPORT_FORMAT.md)
- Do NOT scatter inline links to reference docs through the body -- all in See Also footer
- Flat prose style (no tip/note callout boxes)
