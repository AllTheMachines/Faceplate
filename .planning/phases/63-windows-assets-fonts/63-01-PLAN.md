<objective>
Write the complete multi-window system documentation for the Faceplate user manual.

Purpose: Give users a reference guide to working with multiple windows -- why plugin UIs need multiple windows, how to create and manage them, the difference between release and developer types, window properties, and how to wire buttons to navigate between windows.
Output: `docs/manual/windows.md` -- a complete multi-window reference satisfying WIN-01 through WIN-06.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write the multi-window system documentation</name>
  <files>docs/manual/windows.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/manual/windows.md` following the established topic file format from `canvas.md` and `layers.md`: title, overview paragraph, then content sections.

**IMPORTANT:** This is documentation only. No code changes. Target audience is VST3 developers. This is a REFERENCE document with feature-oriented organization per CONTEXT.md. The one exception is the button navigation action, which uses step-by-step tutorial format.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT DECISIONS (from 63-CONTEXT.md -- these are LOCKED):**
- Feature-oriented organization (reference-style, not task-oriented)
- Window types explained by practical use case, NOT by export implementation details
- Window properties covered naturally within the overview, not as a separate properties table
- Cross-window copy/paste: brief inline mention only, not a dedicated section
- Button navigation action: step-by-step tutorial with screenshot placeholder
- Screenshot placeholders: key screens only (2-3 total)
- Light technical context -- mention JUCE WebView2 terms where relevant
- Flat prose (no tips/callouts boxes), bold for emphasis

The file must contain these sections:

**1. Title and overview**
```
# Multi-Window Projects

Brief introduction explaining what multi-window projects are: most plugins have a single main window, but complex instruments or effects may need separate windows for different sections of the UI (e.g., a main performance view, a settings/preferences panel, or a mixer section).
```

Screenshot placeholder: `![Window tabs showing multiple windows at the bottom of the interface](../images/windows-tabs-bar.png)`

**2. Section: Window Types** (anchored as `## Window Types`)

Explain the two types by USE CASE first (per CONTEXT -- do NOT lead with export details):
- **Release** windows become part of your shipped plugin UI. When you export your project, release windows are included in the generated JUCE WebView2 bundle.
- **Developer** windows are for testing and debugging during design. They are excluded from exports. Developer windows show a **DEV** badge on their tab.

Keep this user-focused. Mention that new windows default to release type.

**3. Section: Managing Windows** (anchored as `## Managing Windows`)

Cover creating, duplicating, renaming, and deleting windows via the tabs bar and context menu. Reference the actual UI from WindowTabs.tsx:

- **Creating a window:** Click the **+** button at the end of the window tabs bar. A new window is created with a default name like "Window 2" and release type.
- **Switching windows:** Click a window tab to switch to it. Each window has its own canvas with its own elements.
- **Renaming a window:** Double-click the window tab name to edit it inline. Press **Enter** to save or **Escape** to cancel. You can also right-click the tab and select **Rename**.
- **Duplicating a window:** Right-click the window tab and select **Duplicate**. This creates a copy of the window (same dimensions and settings) but does not copy the elements.
- **Changing window type:** Right-click the window tab. Under **Window Type**, select **Release** or **Developer**.
- **Deleting a window:** Right-click the window tab and select **Delete**. You cannot delete the last remaining window.

Cover window properties naturally here (not as a separate table per CONTEXT): When no element is selected on the canvas, the Properties panel shows the window's settings -- name, width, height, and background (color, gradient, or image). These dimensions define the exported window size in your JUCE plugin.

Screenshot placeholder: `![Window properties in the Properties panel when no element is selected](../images/windows-properties-panel.png)`

Inline mention of cross-window copy/paste per CONTEXT (brief note, not a dedicated section): You can copy elements from one window and paste them into another using the standard **Ctrl+C** / **Ctrl+V** shortcuts. Switch to the target window tab before pasting.

**4. Section: Button Navigation** (anchored as `## Button Navigation`)

This section uses STEP-BY-STEP TUTORIAL format (the one exception per CONTEXT):

Configure a button element to navigate the user to a different window when clicked. This is how you create navigation between windows in your exported plugin UI.

1. Select a button element on the canvas
2. In the Properties panel, find the **Action** dropdown
3. Select **Navigate to Window**
4. A **Target Window** dropdown appears below
5. Select which window to navigate to when the button is clicked

In the exported JUCE WebView2 bundle, clicking this button will switch the visible window to the target window. This is the primary way users navigate between sections of your plugin UI.

**5. Footer: navigation links**

At the end of the file, include:

[Back to User Manual](README.md) | [Canvas](canvas.md) | [Properties Panel](properties.md) | [Asset Library](assets.md) | [Font Management](fonts.md)
```

**Format rules (same as canvas.md and layers.md):**
- Use bold for UI element names: **Properties** panel, **Action** dropdown, **DEV** badge
- Use backticks for literal values: `release`, `developer`
- Screenshot placeholder format: `![description](../images/filename.png)`
- Do NOT reference React components, TypeScript types, Zustand store, or implementation details
- Do NOT lead with export implementation details in the window types section
- Flat prose style matching existing manual files (no tip/note callout boxes)
