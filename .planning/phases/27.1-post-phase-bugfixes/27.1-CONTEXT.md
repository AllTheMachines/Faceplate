## Priority Order

1. **Critical (Fix First)**
   - BUG-10: Navigation category blank page (blocks all Navigation elements)
   - BUG-08: Visualizations can't be dragged
   - BUG-09: Curves invisible on canvas
   - BUG-06: Meters not rendering

2. **High**
   - BUG-01: Crossfade track
   - BUG-05: LED Ring positioning

3. **Medium**
   - BUG-02, BUG-03: Switch styling
   - BUG-11: Element interactivity

4. **Low**
   - BUG-04: Button fonts
   - BUG-07: Spacer visibility (verify if intentional)
   - BUG-12: Logo timestamp

## Investigation Notes

### BUG-09 (Curves invisible)
User reports: "something is showing up at the canvas but its invisible.. the lines are not visible so therefore the whole elements cant be seen but dragged"
- Elements are being added to store
- Likely a rendering issue (stroke color, canvas context, or visibility)

### BUG-07 (Spacers)
User question: "but maybe thats intentional"
- Spacers are layout elements - investigate whether they should be visible in preview or just in designer

### BUG-11 (Interactivity)
Need to clarify scope:
- Designer canvas controls are for preview only (not interactive by design)
- HTML preview/export should have working controls via bindings.js
- Investigate which elements have non-working controls in HTML preview

## Files Likely Involved

- `src/services/export/htmlGenerator.ts` - HTML generation for preview
- `src/services/export/cssGenerator.ts` - CSS generation for preview
- `src/components/Palette/Palette.tsx` - Palette navigation
- `src/components/Palette/PaletteItem.tsx` - Drag-drop creation
- `src/components/elements/renderers/` - Canvas renderers
- `src/components/Layout/LeftPanel.tsx` - Category navigation

## Success Criteria

1. All 5 visualization types can be dragged to canvas and render visibly
2. All 5 curve types can be dragged to canvas and render with visible lines
3. Navigation & Selection category opens normally without blank page
4. All professional meters render correctly in HTML preview
5. Crossfade slider shows track gradient in preview
6. LED Ring is centered and renders correctly in preview
7. Switch elements match between canvas and preview
8. Logo shows project last-modified time, not current time
