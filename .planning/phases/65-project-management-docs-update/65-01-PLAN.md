<objective>
Create the project management topic file for the user manual and add the container editing section to canvas.md.

Purpose: This completes the user manual's "Workflows" section (the last topic file) and adds container editing documentation that was missing from canvas.md. Together these satisfy requirements PROJ-01 through PROJ-04.

Output: Two documentation files -- one new (`project-management.md`), one updated (`canvas.md` with container editing section).

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create project-management.md topic file</name>
  <files>docs/manual/project-management.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/manual/project-management.md` following the reference-first how-to guide pattern established by other manual topic files (canvas.md, palette.md, etc.).

**Structure:**
```
# Project Management

Overview paragraph (one sentence: Faceplate saves projects as JSON, supports templates, protects unsaved changes).

## Save and Load Projects
- Brief paragraph: projects saved as JSON capturing design state (elements, windows, layers, assets, styles)
- "To save:" File > Save Project (or Ctrl+S) -- browser downloads JSON file
- "To load:" File > Load Project -- select a .json file
- Unsaved changes protection INLINE within this section (NOT a separate subsection):
  - Asterisk (*) in title when unsaved changes exist
  - "Last saved: [time]" display in left panel (shows relative time like "2 minutes ago")
  - Browser warns before closing tab if unsaved changes exist

## Template Import
- Brief explanation: templates are starter projects from existing JUCE designs
- How to import: File > Import Template -- select a JUCE project folder
- What happens: template elements, windows, and settings are loaded into current project (replaces current state)
- One sentence noting this is useful for migrating existing JUCE WebView UIs into Faceplate

## Container Editing
- Brief overview paragraph: containers (Panel, Frame, Group Box, Collapsible) can hold child elements; use Edit Contents button in Properties panel to edit children in isolated view
- Mention three features in a brief list: Edit Contents button, breadcrumb navigation for nested containers, isolated canvas showing only container children
- One sentence: "Containers support overflow scrollbars when content exceeds bounds."
- Cross-reference: "See [Canvas](canvas.md#container-editing) for the full editing workflow."

## Footer
- "---" separator
- "Back to [User Manual](README.md)"
- "See also:" links to FACEPLATE_DOCUMENTATION.md, canvas.md, export.md
```

**Format conventions (from CONTEXT.md decisions):**
- Reference-first format, NOT step-by-step tutorial
- Save/load is brief paragraph (users figure out File > Save)
- Unsaved changes mentioned INLINE within save/load, not a dedicated subsection
- Template import gets its own subsection
- Container editing: brief overview + link to canvas.md
- Screenshot placeholders using `![description](../images/filename.png)` -- include ONE placeholder after save/load section showing the save/load panel with asterisk indicator
- No intro paragraphs per subsection -- go straight into content
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at `docs/manual/project-management.md`. Contains sections: "Save and Load Projects", "Template Import", "Container Editing". Contains cross-reference link to `canvas.md#container-editing`. Contains "See also" footer. Contains screenshot placeholder format `![`.
  </verify>
  <done>
project-management.md exists with save/load (including inline unsaved changes protection), template import subsection, container editing brief overview with cross-reference to canvas.md, and See Also footer.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add container editing section to canvas.md</name>
  <files>docs/manual/canvas.md</files>
  <action>
Read existing `docs/manual/canvas.md` and add a new "## Container Editing" section. Place it AFTER the "## Canvas Settings" section and BEFORE the "## Keyboard Shortcuts" section (since keyboard shortcuts is a summary reference at the end).

**Container Editing section content:**

```markdown
## Container Editing

Containers (Panel, Frame, Group Box, Collapsible) can hold child elements inside them. When you need to add or arrange elements within a container, use the container editing mode.

### Entering Container Edit Mode

1. Select a container element on the canvas
2. In the **Properties** panel, click the **Edit Contents** button (shows child count)
3. The canvas switches to an isolated view showing only the container's children
4. The breadcrumb bar appears at the top showing your navigation path

![Container edit mode with breadcrumb navigation](../images/canvas-container-editing.png)

### Breadcrumb Navigation

The breadcrumb bar shows the path from the root canvas to the current container:

- Click any breadcrumb segment to jump back to that level
- The rightmost segment is the container you're currently editing
- Click the root/first segment to return to the main canvas

### Nested Containers

Containers can hold other containers, creating nested hierarchies:

1. While editing a container's contents, select a child container
2. Click **Edit Contents** again to go one level deeper
3. The breadcrumb extends to show the full nesting path
4. Navigate back using the breadcrumb at any level

### Overflow and Scrollbars

Containers support overflow scrollbars when content exceeds the container bounds. Child elements that extend beyond the container's visible area will be accessible via scrolling in the exported UI.

### Exiting Container Edit Mode

- Click the root segment in the breadcrumb bar to return to the main canvas
- Or click any parent level in the breadcrumb to jump to that container
```

**Also add to the Keyboard Shortcuts table** if there are container-related shortcuts (check codebase -- likely Escape exits container edit mode). If no dedicated shortcut exists, skip.

**Preserve all existing content.** Only add the new section. Do not modify existing sections.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read `docs/manual/canvas.md` and confirm: "## Container Editing" section exists with subsections for entering edit mode, breadcrumb navigation, nested containers, overflow, and exiting. Section is placed after Canvas Settings and before Keyboard Shortcuts.
  </verify>
  <done>
canvas.md has a complete Container Editing section with Enter/Breadcrumb/Nested/Overflow/Exit subsections, placed logically within the document flow, with screenshot placeholder.
  </done>
</task>

1. `docs/manual/project-management.md` exists and contains all four required topics (save/load, unsaved changes inline, template import, container editing overview)
2. `docs/manual/canvas.md` contains "## Container Editing" section with full walkthrough
3. Cross-reference from project-management.md links to `canvas.md#container-editing`
4. Both files follow established manual conventions (screenshot placeholders, footer links, reference-first format)
5. `docs/manual/README.md` already lists project-management.md (line 32) -- verify this is still accurate
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- project-management.md covers PROJ-01 (save/load), PROJ-02 (unsaved changes), PROJ-03 (container editing overview), PROJ-04 (template import)
- canvas.md has the container editing full walkthrough that project-management.md links to
- Both files follow the format conventions established in phases 60-64
- No duplication -- project-management.md summarizes container editing and links to canvas.md for details
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/65-project-management-docs-update/65-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
