<objective>
Update three existing documentation files to reflect the current state of Faceplate through v0.11.0.

Purpose: These canonical reference documents are out of date (claiming v0.9.4 / v1.9). Updating them ensures consistency between the detailed reference docs and the new user manual topic files from phases 60-64. This satisfies requirements UPD-01, UPD-02, UPD-03.

Output: Three updated markdown files with minimal diffs preserving existing quality content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update FACEPLATE_DOCUMENTATION.md to v0.11.0</name>
  <files>docs/FACEPLATE_DOCUMENTATION.md</files>
  <action>
Read the full file and apply MINIMAL DIFF updates. Preserve existing prose, structure, and formatting. Only change what's necessary.

**Required changes (assess each, skip if already correct):**

1. **Version header** (line 5): Change `Version 0.9.4 | February 2026` to `Version 0.11.0 | February 2026`

2. **Key Features list** (around line 29): Verify and update. Currently lists 8 items. Ensure these are present/updated:
   - "107 UI Elements" -- update the count to 107 (the verified count from Palette.tsx registry: 27 controls minus kickbutton = 26, 49 displays minus 6 LEDs = 43, plus containers/decorative/specialized categories unchanged)
   - "Element Styles" -- verify wording mentions all categories (knobs, sliders, buttons, meters), not just knobs
   - Add if missing: "Pro Licensing: Free tier with optional Pro license for advanced elements"
   - Add if missing: "Template Import: Load existing JUCE WebView projects as starting points"
   - Verify "Layer System", "Multi-Window Support", "Contextual Help" are present

3. **Data Model > Project Structure** (around line 227): Update the TypeScript interface:
   - Change `version: number; // Schema version (current: 2)` to `// Schema version (current: 3)`
   - Change `knobStyles: KnobStyle[];` to `elementStyles: ElementStyle[]; // Custom SVG styles for knobs, sliders, buttons, meters`
   - Keep `fonts: Font[];` as-is

4. **Element Types count** (around line 291-317): Verify the element type lists against codebase. Known removals:
   - `kickbutton` was REMOVED in Phase 47 -- delete from Buttons list
   - LEDs were REMOVED in Phase 48 (singleled, bicolorled, tricolorled, ledarray, ledring, ledmatrix) -- remove entire LED line from Displays section
   - Update category counts: Controls should be 26 (was 27, minus kickbutton), Displays count drops by 6 after LED removal
   - **The correct total element count is 107.** Verify by cross-referencing with Palette.tsx registry. Calculate: sum all category counts and confirm they equal 107.

5. **Project File (.json) example** (around line 542): Change `"version": 2` to `"version": 3` and change `"knobStyles": []` to `"elementStyles": []`

6. **Validation schema** (around line 614): Update `ProjectSchemaV2` to `ProjectSchemaV3`, change `z.literal(2)` to `z.literal(3)`, change `knobStyles` to `elementStyles`

7. **Custom Knob Styles section** (around line 1096): Rename to "Element Styles" or "Custom Element Styles". Update text from knob-specific to cover all categories:
   - "Create SVG with specific layer structure" -> mention it varies by category (rotary, linear, button, meter)
   - "Knob Styles tab" -> "Element Styles" or "Manage styles..." in properties panel
   - Update numbered steps to be generic: Import SVG, auto-detect layers, map to roles, apply to element
   - Keep brief -- this section in FACEPLATE_DOCUMENTATION.md should refer to STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md for full details

8. **User Manual quick reference** (around line 845): If "kickbutton" appears in the Buttons list, remove it. If LEDs appear, remove them.

9. **File Structure** (Appendix A, around line 1880): Update `knobStyle.ts` mention to reflect current file if it changed (check if file is now `elementStyle.ts` or still `knobStyle.ts`)

10. **Version History** (Appendix D, around line 2029): Add entries for versions after v1.9:
    - v1.10 (Feb 2026): Element bug fixes (navigation, sliders, curves, buttons, knobs, displays, LED removal)
    - v2.0 (Feb 2026): Pro licensing with Polar.sh, rebrand to Faceplate
    - v0.10.0 (Feb 2026): Element Styles system (SVG styling for sliders, buttons, meters, export support)
    - v0.11.0 (Feb 2026): Complete feature documentation manual

11. **Footer** (end of file): Update version references. Change "v1.9" to "v0.11.0". Update date to "February 2026" if not already.

12. **Add See Also section** before the final footer: Link to `docs/manual/README.md` (user manual) and individual topic files.

**IMPORTANT:** The verified element count is 107. Do NOT use 109. To double-check during execution, scan Palette.tsx for registered element types and count them. The count should be 107.

**Editing approach:** Minimal diff. Only touch lines that need changing. Preserve all existing well-written content.

  <verify>
Read FACEPLATE_DOCUMENTATION.md and verify: version says "0.11.0", Key Features mentions "107 UI Elements" and Element Styles (multi-category), Pro Licensing, and Template Import. Project schema shows version 3 with elementStyles. kickbutton and LEDs are removed from element lists. Version History includes v1.10, v2.0, v0.10.0, v0.11.0. See Also section exists linking to manual. Element count totals 107 (not 109).
  </verify>
  <done>
FACEPLATE_DOCUMENTATION.md accurately reflects v0.11.0 with 107 elements, all features since v0.9.4 documented, schema updated to v3, element counts corrected, and cross-references to user manual added.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update ELEMENT_REFERENCE.md</name>
  <files>docs/ELEMENT_REFERENCE.md</files>
  <action>
Read the FULL file (all sections). Apply MINIMAL DIFF updates. This task requires reading the entire file to verify every element entry.

**Required changes:**

1. **Element count verification:** The verified total is **107 elements** (confirmed by counting the Palette.tsx registry). This accounts for:
   - kickbutton REMOVED (Phase 47): -1 from Controls
   - 6 LEDs REMOVED (Phase 48: singleled, bicolorled, tricolorled, ledarray, ledring, ledmatrix): -6 from Displays
   - Any elements ADDED since original count (e.g., rangeslider)

   Update the summary table total to **107**. Do NOT use 109.

2. **Category counts in summary table** (around line 7-16): Update each category count to match actual element entries in the file. After LED and kickbutton removal:
   - Controls: verify actual count (was 27, minus kickbutton = 26, plus any additions like rangeslider)
   - Displays: verify actual count (was 49, minus 6 LEDs = 43, plus any additions)
   - Other categories: verify unchanged
   - **Total must equal 107.** Cross-check by counting all `####` element headings in the file after edits.

3. **styleId property:** Add `styleId` property row to every element type that supports it. Currently only `knob` has it (line 54). Add to:
   - All knob variants: `steppedknob`, `centerdetentknob`, `dotindicatorknob`
   - All slider variants: `slider`, `arcslider`, `bipolarslider`, `crossfadeslider`, `notchedslider`, `multislider`
   - All button/switch variants: `button`, `iconbutton`, `toggleswitch`, `powerbutton`, `rockerswitch`, `rotaryswitch`, `segmentbutton`
   - Meter: `meter` (basic meter element)

   For each, add as first property row:
   ```
   | `styleId` | string | - | Element Style ID for custom SVG appearance |
   ```

   Also add a brief note to each element's description line: "Supports custom SVG styles via Element Styles." (only if not already present -- knob already has this)

4. **Remove kickbutton entry:** Delete the entire `#### kickbutton` section if present.

5. **Remove LED entries:** Delete all LED element sections (singleled, bicolorled, tricolorled, ledarray, ledring, ledmatrix).

6. **Verify every remaining element entry** against the codebase:
   - Check `src/types/elements/controls.ts` for control element types
   - Check other type files for display, visualization, curve, container, decorative, specialized types
   - Ensure no element is missing from the reference
   - Ensure no deleted element remains in the reference

   If any element exists in code but NOT in the reference, add a basic entry with key properties. If any element is in the reference but NOT in code, remove it.

7. **Add rangeslider if missing:** The `rangeslider` element type exists in the codebase (added in Phase 55). If not in ELEMENT_REFERENCE.md, add it under Sliders with properties: `styleId`, `orientation`, `min`, `max`, `valueLow`, `valueHigh`, colors.

8. **Add See Also section** at end of file, before any existing footer:
   ```markdown
   ## See Also

   - [User Manual](manual/README.md) -- Complete user guide with tutorials
   - [Properties Panel Guide](manual/properties.md) -- How to use the Properties panel
   - [Element Styles Guide](manual/styles.md) -- Custom SVG styles for elements
   - [Style Creation Manual](STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md) -- SVG layer naming and import workflow
   ```

**CRITICAL:** The final total count in the summary table MUST be 107. After all additions and removals, count the actual `####` element heading entries in the file to confirm. If the count is not 107, investigate and reconcile before finishing.

**Editing approach:** Minimal diff. Only change lines that are wrong or add missing content. Preserve all existing property tables and descriptions.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read ELEMENT_REFERENCE.md summary table and verify: total count shows **107** (not 109). No LEDs in Displays, no kickbutton in Controls. Search for "styleId" -- should appear in knob, steppedknob, centerdetentknob, dotindicatorknob, slider, arcslider, bipolarslider, crossfadeslider, notchedslider, multislider, button, iconbutton, toggleswitch, powerbutton, rockerswitch, rotaryswitch, segmentbutton, meter entries. See Also section exists. Count all `####` element headings -- must total 107.
  </verify>
  <done>
ELEMENT_REFERENCE.md has total count of 107, styleId properties on all supported categories, removed elements (kickbutton, LEDs) deleted, all entries verified against codebase, and See Also section added.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md</name>
  <files>docs/STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md</files>
  <action>
Read the full file and apply MINIMAL DIFF updates to generalize language from knob-specific to generic where appropriate.

**Assessment:** The file is ALREADY fairly well generalized (title says "Custom Element Styles", overview mentions knobs/sliders/buttons/meters, layer roles are documented per category). The main updates needed are:

1. **Title/overview verification:** Already says "Creating Custom Element Styles" and mentions all categories. Verify and tweak any remaining knob-specific language in the overview section.

2. **Part 1 step text** (around line 30): Currently says "Drag a Knob (or Slider, Button, Meter)". This is fine -- it leads with the most common case.

3. **Part 3 guidelines** (around line 127-135): Check for knob-specific language:
   - "Square for knobs" -- add note about sliders being rectangular
   - "For knobs, the indicator group rotates" -- generalize: "For rotary elements (knobs), the indicator group rotates around center"
   - Example SVG structure (line 141) is knob-specific -- add a brief note: "This example shows a rotary (knob) style. For other categories, adapt the layer IDs to match the roles listed in Part 2."

4. **Category notes:** The layer role tables in Part 2 (lines 56-112) are already well-organized by category. Verify completeness:
   - Rotary (Knobs) -- looks complete
   - Linear (Sliders) -- looks complete
   - Arc (Arc Sliders) -- looks complete
   - Button (Buttons, Switches) -- looks complete
   - Meter (Level Meters) -- looks complete

5. **Pro license note** (line 21): Currently says "Meter styles are available to all users. Knob/Slider styles require Pro license." Verify this is still accurate. If button styles also require Pro, update.

6. **Part 4 step text** (line 166): "Click on a Knob if importing a rotary style" -- generalize: "Click on an element of the matching type (e.g., a Knob for rotary styles, a Slider for linear styles)"

7. **Quick Reference section** (line 287): Already generic. Verify naming conventions and minimum required layers tables are correct.

8. **Add See Also section** at end:
   ```markdown
   ## See Also

   - [User Manual](manual/README.md) -- Complete user guide
   - [Element Styles Guide](manual/styles.md) -- Overview of the style system
   - [Element Reference](ELEMENT_REFERENCE.md) -- All element types with styleId property
   ```

9. **Add brief category summary** somewhere near the top (after Overview, before Part 1). Something like:
   ```markdown
   ### Supported Categories

   The style system supports five element categories, each with its own layer structure:

   | Category | Elements | Key Layer |
   |----------|----------|-----------|
   | Rotary | Knob, Stepped Knob, Center Detent, Dot Indicator | `indicator` (rotating pointer) |
   | Linear | Slider, Bipolar, Crossfade, Notched, Multi-Slider | `thumb` (draggable handle) |
   | Arc | Arc Slider | `thumb` (handle on arc path) |
   | Button | Button, Icon Button, Toggle, Power, Rocker, Rotary Switch, Segment | `normal` (default state) |
   | Meter | Meter | `body` (meter housing) |
   ```

**Editing approach:** Minimal diff. The file is already mostly generalized. Only tweak specific phrases that are unnecessarily knob-centric.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md and verify: title uses "Element Styles" not "Knob Styles", overview mentions all categories, no section exclusively refers to knobs without acknowledging other categories, Supported Categories table exists, See Also section exists.
  </verify>
  <done>
STYLE_CREATION_MANUAL.md uses generic element terminology, has a Supported Categories summary table, all category-specific sections are accurate, and See Also section links to manual topic files.
  </done>
