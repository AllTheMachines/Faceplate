<objective>
Write the complete getting started guide for the Faceplate user manual.

Purpose: Give a new user everything they need to go from zero to their first configured element on canvas -- covering installation, interface orientation, and a hands-on tutorial.
Output: `docs/manual/getting-started.md` -- a self-contained guide that satisfies START-01, START-02, START-03, and demonstrates the MAN-02 consistent format.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write the getting started guide</name>
  <files>docs/manual/getting-started.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/manual/getting-started.md` following the consistent topic file format established in the research: title, overview paragraph, step-by-step sections, screenshot placeholders.

The file must contain these sections:

**1. Title and overview**
```
# Getting Started

Faceplate is a visual designer for creating audio plugin user interfaces. You design your UI by dragging elements onto a canvas, configuring their properties, and exporting production-ready code for JUCE WebView2. This guide walks you through installation, introduces the interface, and takes you through creating your first element.
```

**2. Section: Installation** (anchored as `## Installation` for TOC link from README.md)

Prerequisites:
- Node.js 18 or later (download from https://nodejs.org)
- npm (included with Node.js)

**Option A: Download Release** (recommended for users)
1. Download the latest ZIP from GitHub Releases
2. Extract the ZIP to a folder
3. Open a terminal in the extracted folder
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

**Option B: Clone Repository** (for developers)
1. `git clone https://github.com/AllTheMachines/Faceplate.git`
2. `cd Faceplate`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Open http://localhost:5173

Include a screenshot placeholder:
`![Faceplate running in the browser with a blank canvas](../images/getting-started-fresh-launch.png)`

**3. Section: Interface Overview** (anchored as `## Interface Overview`)

Explain the three-panel layout with a labeled screenshot placeholder:
`![Three-panel layout showing left panel, canvas, and properties panel](../images/interface-overview.png)`

Describe each panel:

**Left Panel** (250px, left side):
- Header showing "Faceplate" with last-saved timestamp
- Undo/Redo buttons (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y)
- Three tabs:
  - **Elements** -- The element palette with draggable UI components organized by category
  - **Assets** -- The asset library for imported SVG graphics
  - **Layers** -- Layer management for organizing elements by depth

**Canvas** (center, flexible width):
- The main design surface where you build your UI
- Drag elements here from the palette
- Click elements to select them, drag to move, handles to resize
- Window tabs appear below the canvas when working with multiple windows

**Properties Panel** (300px, right side):
- Shows properties for the currently selected element
- Common properties: position, size, name, parameterId
- Element-specific settings (colors, ranges, behavior)
- When no element is selected, shows window properties (dimensions, background)

**4. Section: Quick Start Tutorial** (anchored as `## Quick Start`)

A numbered walkthrough with screenshot placeholders at key steps:

**Step 1: Open the Element Palette**
- Click the **Elements** tab in the left panel (it should be selected by default)
- You will see element categories: Controls, Buttons & Switches, Value Displays, etc.
- Screenshot: `![Element palette showing categories of available elements](../images/getting-started-palette.png)`

**Step 2: Add a Knob to the Canvas**
- Find **Knob** under the **Controls** category
- Click and drag it onto the canvas
- Release to place it -- a knob element appears on the canvas
- Screenshot: `![Knob element placed on the canvas](../images/getting-started-knob-placed.png)`

**Step 3: Select and Inspect the Element**
- Click the knob on the canvas to select it
- Blue resize handles appear around the element
- The Properties panel on the right updates to show the knob's settings
- Screenshot: `![Selected knob with properties panel showing knob settings](../images/getting-started-knob-selected.png)`

**Step 4: Configure the Element**
- In the Properties panel, find the **parameterId** field
- Enter a parameter name like `gain` -- this is how JUCE will connect this knob to your audio processing
- Adjust other properties: change colors, set min/max range, modify the label
- Screenshot: `![Properties panel with parameterId set to gain](../images/getting-started-parameter-binding.png)`

**Step 5: Preview Your Design**
- Click the **Export** button in the properties panel area
- Select **Browser Preview** to see your UI rendered as it would appear in a plugin
- The preview opens in a new browser tab showing your design
- Screenshot: `![Browser preview showing the designed UI](../images/getting-started-preview.png)`

**Tip:** Enable snap grid with **Ctrl+G** to align elements precisely. Use **arrow keys** to nudge selected elements by 1px (or **Shift+Arrow** for 10px).

**5. Section: Next Steps**

Brief pointers to what to learn next, with links to other manual topics:
- [Canvas](canvas.md) -- Learn about selection modes, copy/paste, zoom, and snap grid
- [Element Palette](palette.md) -- Explore all available element categories and types
- [Properties Panel](properties.md) -- Deep dive into element configuration and parameter binding
- [Layers](layers.md) -- Organize complex layouts with multiple layers
- [Export](export.md) -- Export a production JUCE WebView2 bundle

Also link back to the manual index:
- Back to [User Manual](README.md)

**Format rules:**
- Use bold for UI element names: **Elements** tab, **Properties** panel
- Use backtick for values and commands: `gain`, `npm run dev`, `Ctrl+G`
- Use bold for keyboard shortcuts in text: **Ctrl+Z**, **Shift+Arrow**
- Every section gets at least one screenshot placeholder with descriptive filename
- Screenshot filenames follow pattern: `getting-started-{subject}.png`
- Do NOT reference React components, TypeScript types, or implementation details -- this is user-facing
