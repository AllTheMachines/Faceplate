Phase 11 is COMPLETE and verified. User performed manual verification of all 8 human-testable items - all passed.

Session included post-phase polish work:
1. Added relative/asset path support for images
2. Collapsed keyboard shortcuts panel by default
3. Removed redundant ZOrderPanel (shortcuts already in help panel)

User raised important discussion about NEXT work: template import issues with existing WebView2 UIs.
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Phase 11 plans 1-4: All complete and verified
- Human verification: All 8 items tested and passed by user
- Image path support: Added asset path detection, updated placeholder to `/assets/image.png`
- Help panel: Changed to collapsed by default
- ZOrderPanel: Removed (redundant with keyboard shortcuts)
- Created `public/assets/` folder for serving images during development
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Commit the post-phase polish changes
- Plan Phase 12 based on user's import/template discussion
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Asset paths use `/assets/...` format (served from `public/assets/` by Vite)
- Relative paths preserved in export for deployment flexibility
- ZOrderPanel removed since Z-Order shortcuts already exist in keyboard shortcuts panel
- Keyboard shortcuts collapsed by default to reduce visual clutter
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None - ready for next phase planning

<context>
User described a significant issue: importing existing WebView2 UI code results in all elements becoming knobs at 0,0. This is because:
1. Current import parser was built for THIS designer's export format
2. User's existing WebView2 UIs use completely different patterns/structure
3. Parser can't recognize their custom element markup

User proposed two workflow directions:
1. **New project from template**: Start fresh with VST3 effect/instrument skeletons, design UI in this tool
2. **Convert existing UI**: Parse existing WebView2 HTML/CSS/JS and migrate to designer format

User mentioned they're building "empty VST3 containers" and may provide sample code.

Key insight from user: "maybe it doesnt make sense to try to import other Webview2 files because they are made completly different. maybe just parse them. get the same size and replicate something similar with position etc."

This suggests Phase 12 should focus on:
- Smarter import that extracts what it can (dimensions, positions, colors)
- Creates placeholder elements that user can then refine
- OR a "new project wizard" with VST3 templates

<next_action>
1. Commit the uncommitted polish changes from this session
2. Discuss Phase 12 scope with user - need sample of their existing WebView2 code to assess what's parseable
3. Decide between "smart import" vs "new project templates" as primary focus
</next_action>
