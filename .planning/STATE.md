**Core value:** Visually design a plugin UI and export code that works in JUCE WebView2 without manual fixups.
**Current focus:** v1.2 Complete Element Taxonomy - Phases 19-30

## Current Position

Phase: 19 - Architecture Refactoring
Plan: Not yet started
Status: Roadmap created, ready for planning
Last activity: 2026-01-26 — v1.2 roadmap created

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (Phase 19 not started)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 62
- Average duration: ~25 min
- Total execution time: ~25 hours

**Velocity (v1.1):**
- Total plans completed: 26
- Average duration: ~6 min
- Total execution time: ~3 hours
- Milestone duration: 2 days (2026-01-25 → 2026-01-26)

**Combined (v1.0 + v1.1):**
- Total phases: 18
- Total plans: 88

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
All v1.1 decisions documented and outcomes verified.

### Pending Todos

None — v1.2 roadmap complete, ready to start Phase 19.

### Blockers/Concerns

None — v1.2 roadmap validated.

**Critical success factor for v1.2:**
- Phase 19 (Architecture Refactoring) is non-negotiable prerequisite
- Must complete refactoring before adding any new elements (Phases 20-30)
- Research recommendations flag Phase 23 (Professional Meters) and Phase 25 (Real-Time Visualizations) as needing deeper research during planning

## Session Continuity
