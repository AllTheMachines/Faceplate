# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-23)

**Core value:** Visually design a plugin UI and export code that works in JUCE WebView2 without manual fixups.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Element Library

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Element Library)
Plan: 1 of 1 in phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-23 — Completed 02-01-PLAN.md (Element type system & HTML canvas)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 12.5% (1/8 phases complete, Phase 2 Plan 01 complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: 3.31 min
- Total execution time: 0.22 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3/3 | 9.5 min | 3.17 min |
| 02-element-library | 1/1 | 3.77 min | 3.77 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- 01-01: 5.5 min (foundation infrastructure)
- 01-02: 3 min (layout and canvas)
- 01-03: 1 min (pan and zoom)
- 02-01: 3.77 min (element types + HTML canvas refactor)
- Trend: Stable velocity (3-4 min for standard plans)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Tech stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, @dnd-kit, Tailwind CSS chosen for fast iteration
- **Research addition**: react-konva must be added as canvas rendering library (critical gap identified)
- **Undo architecture**: Must use command pattern or Zustand temporal middleware (zundo), not naive snapshots
- **Coordinate systems**: Typed coordinate utilities required in Phase 1 to prevent mixing screen/canvas/element spaces
- **Phase ordering**: Element Library moved to Phase 2 (from Phase 8) to enable testing with real elements from Phase 3 onward
- **React-konva version** (01-01): Explicitly use react-konva@18.x for React 18 compatibility, not v19
- **Viewport undo exclusion** (01-01): Viewport state (scale, offset, panning) excluded from undo history - camera position should not be undoable
- **Dark mode strategy** (01-01): Use Tailwind manual dark mode (class strategy) for explicit control rather than system preference
- **Canvas default size** (01-02): 800x600 with range 100-4000 for UI design workspace
- **Layout structure** (01-02): Three-panel grid with 250px left sidebar, flexible center, 300px right sidebar
- **Background listening** (01-02): Canvas background Rect uses listening=false to prevent event interference
- **Pan interaction** (01-03): Spacebar+drag for panning (Figma pattern), not middle-click or click-drag
- **Zoom range** (01-03): 0.1 (10%) to 10 (1000%) for maximum design flexibility
- **Zoom transform** (01-03): Two-step coordinate calculation keeps cursor point stationary during zoom
- **HTML/CSS rendering** (02-01): Migrated from react-konva to HTML/CSS transforms for true WYSIWYG (elements render as HTML exactly as they export)
- **Transform order** (02-01): CSS transform must be `translate() scale()` order (translate before scale) for correct zoom/pan
- **Transform origin** (02-01): Set transformOrigin to '0 0' to simplify coordinate calculations

### Pending Todos

- **Future enhancement:** Add ability to type zoom percentage directly in zoom indicator (user feedback from 01-03)

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1:** COMPLETE (3/3 plans complete)
- ✅ react-konva@18 added and verified
- ✅ Coordinate transform utilities implemented with branded types
- ✅ Three-panel layout with responsive sizing
- ✅ Canvas Stage with viewport transforms
- ✅ Spacebar+drag panning with grab cursor UX
- ✅ Scroll/pinch zoom centered on cursor
- ✅ All Phase 1 success criteria met
- SVG vs hybrid rendering decision deferred to Phase 3 (Canvas Basics)

**Phase 2 (Element Library):** PLAN 01 COMPLETE (1/1)
- ✅ Element type system created (6 types with discriminated unions)
- ✅ Elements store slice with CRUD operations
- ✅ Canvas refactored from react-konva to HTML/CSS transforms
- ✅ Pan and zoom preserved with HTML events
- react-konva kept in package.json as fallback (remove in Phase 8 if unused)
- Phase 2 complete - ready for Phase 3 (Canvas Basics)

**Phase 8 (Code Export):**
- JUCE WebView2 API integration needs deeper research during planning
- Code export templates require validation with real JUCE project
